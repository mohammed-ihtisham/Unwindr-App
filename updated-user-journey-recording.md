# Important Note:
In the video, there is a Hidden Gem Filter that isn't mentioned. This is because it originally relied on a MediaAnalytics concepts (Likes, Shares, etc.) which I removed since it doesn't make sense for this early-stage app without an abundance of users. However, last minute, I realized I can still have a HiddenGem functionality through a different method, which will rely on some syncs that I'll be doing for the final assignment, and so I decided to keep it in the frontend since it's functionality will work once I add those syncs.
