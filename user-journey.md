# User Journey 

**Disclaimer:** For now, I’m using sample images across Unwindr while I finalize the Google Places API integration. Since the API’s free tier has a limited quota, I wanted to confirm a few things before enabling real image fetching so I don’t waste requests unnecessarily. Everything else (including filtering, login, and map interaction) works as expected for the **basic** user journey.

Alex visits Unwindr to explore places in the Boston and Cambridge area and is greeted by an interactive map filled with hundreds of image previews marking different destinations, alongside a right-hand panel listing matching places. Wanting to describe the kind of experience he’s looking for, he clicks the Interest Filter but is prompted to log in, so he quickly creates an account and signs in. He then types “place with a lot of nature and water to watch sunset,” and the LLM selects relevant tags such as Nature Walks, Waterfront Views, and Sunset spots, filtering the map to highlight only scenic, nature-focused spots. One location, Boston Public Garden, stands out with lush greenery and water views, so he clicks it to see details, browse through its slideshow of photos, and decide it’s worth visiting. Consequently, he clicks views more images to see all relevant images on Google and reaffirms his decision. He goes back to the website and clicks get directions to see how he can get there, which looks good to him, so he clicks the Share button and sends the location details to his friends. Thinking ahead, he reopens the filter, switches to manual tag selection, and chooses Fast Food and Restaurant to find places nearby where he can relax and eat after his walk, updating the map to reveal inviting spots throughout Boston and Cambridge for him to explore.
