# User Journey 

**Disclaimer:** For now, I’m using sample images across Unwindr while I finalize the Google Places API integration. Since the API’s free tier has a limited quota, I wanted to confirm a few things before enabling real image fetching so I don’t waste requests unnecessarily. Everything else (including filtering, login, and map interaction) works as expected for the **basic** user journey.

Bob visits Unwindr to explore places in the Boston and Cambridge area and is greeted by an interactive map filled with thousands of image previews marking different destinations, alongside a right-hand panel listing matching places. Wanting to describe the kind of experience he’s looking for, he clicks the Interest Filter but is prompted to log in, so he quickly creates an account and signs in. He then types “beautiful nature scenery and waterfront views,” and the LLM selects relevant tags such as Park and Nature, filtering the map to highlight only scenic, nature-focused spots. One location, Gateway Greenspace, stands out with lush greenery and water views, so he clicks it to see details, browse through its slideshow of photos, and decide it’s worth visiting. Thinking ahead, he reopens the filter, switches to manual tag selection, and chooses Cafe and Restaurant to find places nearby where he can relax and eat after his walk, updating the map to reveal inviting spots throughout Boston and Cambridge for him to explore.
